His second appearance will have nothing to do with sin, for that work is finished. Instead, He will come to complete the salvation of His people—to rescue us fully from the very presence of sin and evil. Our posture is to be one of eager waiting, confident that the One who finished the work of redemption will return to finish our deliverance.`,
    prayer: `Savior, thank you that your work on the cross is completely sufficient. There is no more sacrifice for sin. I eagerly wait for your second appearance, not with fear, but with anticipation for the full salvation you will bring. Amen.`,
